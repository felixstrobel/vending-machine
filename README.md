# Vending machine

This is the code for my school project to build a vending machine. The machine should be able to eject products. These products can be ordered via a mobile phone app. We used an ESP32 to handle the customer requests and to power the servos.
The code is partly written in German ... please excuse that. For reasons of time, there is only one implementation of one servo. So only one product can be ejected.
